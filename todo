1. make peers recoverable : kill and bring it back up, other peers should be able to connect back with it
2. save persistent state to disk :  but when ??
3.


open questions :
1. should we have heartbeat timeout individually for each peer
2. should we not send a heartbeat, until we get a response back from the peer!

log structure considerations:
1. adding a common log to the beginning of every peer log for ease of implementation
2. What if the client sending the message is the leader ?! - done
3. leader should set the peer_next_log to latest for a peer when a new peer joins!


async client considerations :
1. if a client sends multiple requests, what if req1,2 go through, and the third fails. Should we allow 4,5 to go through.
2. if 3 fails, should the client retry.
