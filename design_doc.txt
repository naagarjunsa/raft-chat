Hello This is the design document for the raft implementation. LESSGOOO!

Current Understanding : 

    1. UI thread to take input -> Question, should the user be able to send another request till the response is recv for the prev one? (NFC) I think we will wait, cause makes life easy.

        Each user command should have an id : id can be < cid, idx of the request > -> need to maintain that in the state file then lol (cause crash life)

    2. maintain the timeout for the follower state change -> need to create the thread for the same 

    3. implement the followers logic along with the RPC's
